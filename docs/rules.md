## Checks
Most storytelling can be resolved through roleplay, but there are often situations where the outcome is uncertain and risk is involved. In these situations, the Game Master can call for a check. Checks use twenty-sided dice to determine success or failure (or something in between) through randomness and luck, but checks also take into account the circumstances, whether they be beneficial or perilous.

### When Checks Don't Help

### Plot Points
Sometimes, things don't go as planned. While the purpose of using dice is to introduce uncertianty and suspense into the narrative, there are times where either the Game Master or the players aren't willing to take that risk. Plot points exist to provide each player with a bit more narrative authority when it really counts, but at a price.

There are a number of shared plot points equal to the number of players, including the Game Master. These points can either be lucky or unlucky. Whenever a lucky plot point is spent, it becomes unlucky, and whenever an unlucky plot point is spent, it becomes lucky again.

 When a player fails a check, they can choose to spend a lucky plot point to retry that check, giving them a second chance at success. The reverse is also true; a player may spend an unlucky plot point to reroll a successful check, potentially making them fail.

The Game Master may also spend unlucky plot points in order to reroll a check, whether it was successful or not. Additionally, the Game Master can also spend unlucky plot points to force a player to reroll a check, but only if that player has decided to not use any plot points themself.

### Advantage & Disadvantage
Sometimes, circumstances alter the likelihood of success, such attempting to enter a noble's mansion while having a good local reputation, or trying to haggle prices with a merchant whom you just offended. Advantage adds a bonus die to a check, reflecting a positive circumstance, while disadvantage is the opposite: a penalty die that is subtracted from a check.

Multiple circumstances may simultaneously impose advantage or disadvantage, so the kind of die used is determined by the number of advantages or disadvantages. One advantage or disadvantage uses a d4, two use a d6, three use a d8, four use a d10, and five or more use a d12. If circumstances cause a check to have both advantage and disadvantage, each advantage cancels out one disadvantage, and the remaining advantage or disadvantage is applied.

### How To Make Checks
Below are the steps to making a check:

1. **Roll the d20(s).** Determine which ability score would make most sense to use in the situation. If that ability score is weak, roll two d20s and keep the lowest result. If that ability score is strong, roll two d20s and keep the highest result. If that ability score is average, just roll a single d20 and use its result.
2. **Add proficiency.** Add the appropriate skill or tool proficiency. If you don't have that skill or tool proficiency, skip this step.
3. **Roll the advantage or disadvantage die.** The die used for this depends on how many advantages or disadvantages you have. Add it to the result of the d20.
4. **Compare results.** In a contest, the party with the highest number wins. In a static check, success occurs if the result is higher than or equal to the difficulty. Most checks end at this step.
5. **Determine the margin of success (or failure).** Sometimes, the amount by which you succeed or fail matters. In a contest, the margin is the difference between your result and your opponent's result. In a static check, it is the difference between your result and the difficulty. If you lost a contest or failed a static check, this number will be negative.

### Special Dice Results
When a player makes a check, the dice have a small chance to both result in the highest or lowest possible numbers. These rare and exciting results have additional effects. When the d20 lands on a 1, a lucky plot point becomes unlucky. When the d20 lands on a 20, an unlucky plot point becomes lucky. If there aren't enough lucky or unlucky plot points to do this, the Game Master may determine an alternative rewarding or punishing effect.

:::tip don't fudge rolls
"Fudging a roll" is where a Game Master disregards the result of the dice (often rolled behind a screen) in order to to steer the narrative in a more desirable direction. This is done in order to prevent outcomes that are disappointing to either the players or the Game Master. Unfortunately, the secretive nature of fudging can leave players feeling betrayed or powerless, especially if a Game Master abuses this practice.

Plot points are intended to be a more honest and transparent solution to that same problem by allowing everybody a similar level of narrative control during critical moments. Even so, plot points can't cover every situation! If a plot detail needs to be changed or undone, it is better to discuss this openly with your table and collectively agree on how to move forward. Keep the storytelling shared!

## Strain & Wounds
Strain represents minor stress or injury. Strain is entirely removed after a long rest. Every 4 strain gets converted into 1 wound.

Wounds represent life-threatening physical or mental injury. Wounds last until they are healed, which take time and rest. Each long rest, make a check for each wound (difficulty and skill may vary, difficulty 10 Fortitude by default). On a success, the wound recovers.

The amount of wounds a character can withstand before having a near-death experience is 15. on the 16th wound, they have a near-death experience.

If a character has one to four wounds, they are merely Exhausted, and are capable of healing without complication. If a character has five to eight wounds, they are Injured. Whenever an Injured character fails a check, they gain 1 strain. If a character has nine to twelve wounds, they are Severely Injured. Whenever a Severely Injured character makes a check, they gain 1 strain. If a character has thirteen to fifteen wounds, they are Dying. Every check a Dying character makes adds 1 strain, and if that check failed they gain an additional 1 strain. If a character has sixteen wounds, they have a Near-Death Experience.
