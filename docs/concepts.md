## Traits
:::caution rough idea

:::

each assigned to categories, either mind, body, or soul

can be strictly positive (+) or strictly negative (-) or just neutral (±), ranging from 1 to 3
neutral traits can be used either as positive or negative, depending on the situation
1 is notable, 2 is significant, and 3 is extreme

traits are either permanent, temporary, or granted

permanent traits stay on a character until removed, while temporary traits stay on a character only as long as certain conditions are met, like a trait granted by a magic spell or a negative status effect

traits influence success or failure when dice are rolled

## Health

numerical values split up into three categories: mind, body, and soul
mind is intelligence and wisdom
body is physical fortitude
soul is identity and willpower

each can be temporarily reduced when taking damage

each category's value is equal to the number of corresponding strictly positive permanent traits tied to that category

when a category would be reduced to less than zero, it is reset to zero and that character has a near-death experience

## Checks
Most storytelling can be resolved through roleplay, but there are often situations where the outcome is uncertain and risk is involved. In these situations, the Game Master can call for a check. A check uses two six-sided dice to determine success or failure (or something in between) through randomness and luck, but checks also take into account the circumstances, whether they be beneficial or perilous.

Below are the steps to making a check:

1. **Determine relevant traits.** Choose the largest three positive traits and the largest three negative traits that are relevant to the situation, if there are that many.
2. **Determine advantages & disadvantages.** Gain an advantage for each positive trait beyond the first, then gain a disadvantage for each negative trait beyond the first. Each advantage cancels out one disadvantage, and vice-versa.
3. **Roll the dice.** Roll two six-sided dice. You may reroll the lowest die for each advantage. You must reroll the highest die for each disadvantage.
4. **Apply the most significant traits.** Add the largest positive trait and the largest negative trait to the sum of the dice.
5. **Apply difficulty.** Subtract the difficulty from the sum.
6. **Declare the outcome.** The total sum determines success or failure (or something in between).

### Check Results
| Dice result | Do I succeed? |
|:---:|---|
| 3 or less | **"No, and …"**: You fail, and something else bad happpens. |
| 4–5 | **"No."**: You don't succeed. |
| 6–7 | **"No, but …"**: You don't succeed, but something else good happens. |
| 8–9 | **"Yes, but …"**: You succeed, but something else bad happens. |
| 10–11 | **"Yes."**: You succeed. |
| 12 or more | **"Yes, and …"**: You succeed, and something else good happens. |

### Advantage & Disadvantage
Sometimes, circumstances alter the likelihood of success, such attempting to leap across a ravine while wearing enchanted shoes, or trying to haggle prices with a merchant whom you just offended. Advantages allow you to reroll the lowest die when making a check reflecting a positive circumstance, but disadvantages force you to reroll the highest die instead.

You might have more than one advantage or disadvantage, and you might have both at the same time. If this happens, each disadvantage cancels out one advantage, until there is only either advantages or disadvantages left. Each remaining advantage or disadvantage is applied to the check.

### Difficulty
Some outcomes are more likely than others. The Game Master may set a difficulty for a check, which is a number that is subtracted from the result of a check to represent how hard any task should be. Any integer between 0 and -6 can be used. A difficulty of 0 is easy, -2 is hard, and -4 is punishing. For extreme cases bordering on impossible, -6 is the maximum possible difficulty.

:::warning impossible checks
It is important to note that a check with difficulty -7 is mathematically impossible to succeed at. Do not use difficulties beyond -6. If a task is impossible, it is better to communicate that and not allow a check at all.

stamina points

can be used to power spells or powerful fighting moves

limited amount that recharges after a full night's rest

can take damage to any health category in lieu of using stamina, if stamina is already expended

## Plot Points
Sometimes, things don't go as planned. While the purpose of using dice is to introduce uncertianty and suspense into the narrative, there are times where either the Game Master or the players aren't willing to take that risk. Plot points exist to provide each player with a bit more narrative authority when it really counts, but at a price.

There are a number of shared plot points equal to the number of players, including the Game Master. These points can either be lucky or unlucky. Whenever a lucky plot point is spent, it becomes unlucky, and whenever an unlucky plot point is spent, it becomes lucky again.

 When a player fails a check, they can choose to spend a lucky plot point to retry that check, giving them a second chance at success. The reverse is also true; a player may spend an unlucky plot point to reroll a successful check, potentially making them fail.

The Game Master may also spend unlucky plot points in order to reroll a check, whether it was successful or not. Additionally, the Game Master can also spend unlucky plot points to force a player to reroll a check, but only if that player has decided to not use any plot points themself.

### Special Dice Results
When a player makes a check, the dice have a small chance to both result in either sixes or ones. These rare and exciting results have additional effects. When both dice result in ones, a lucky plot point becomes unlucky. When both dice result in sixes, an unlucky plot point becomes lucky. If there aren't enough lucky or unlucky plot points to do this, the Game Master may determine an alternative rewarding or punishing effect.

:::tip don't fudge rolls
"Fudging a roll" is where a Game Master disregards the result of the dice (often rolled behind a screen) in order to to steer the narrative in a more desirable direction. This is done in order to prevent outcomes that are disappointing to either the players or the Game Master. Unfortunately, the secretive nature of fudging can leave players feeling betrayed or powerless, especially if a Game Master abuses this practice.

Plot points are intended to be a more honest and transparent solution to that same problem by allowing everybody a similar level of narrative control during critical moments. Even so, plot points can't cover every situation! If a plot detail needs to be changed or undone, it is better to discuss this openly with your table and collectively agree on how to move forward. Keep the storytelling shared!
