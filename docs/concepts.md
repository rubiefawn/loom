Add intro to general game concepts here

# Traits
:::caution rough idea
each assigned to categories, either mind, body, or soul

can be positive or negative, ranging from -5 to +5, and are added to the d20 when making checks where that trait is relevant

traits are either permanent, temporary, or granted

permanent traits stay on a character until removed, while temporary traits stay on a character only as long as certain conditions are met, like a trait granted by a magic spell or a negative status effect
:::

# Health
:::caution rough idea
numerical values split up into three categories: mind, body, and soul
mind is intelligence and wisdom
body is physical fortitude
soul is identity and willpower

each can be temporarily reduced when taking damage

each category's value is equal to the number of corresponding positive permanent traits tied to that category

when a category would be reduced to less than zero, it is reset to zero and that character has a near-death experience

# Game Dice & Checks
:::caution rough idea
d20 used for success or failure

d12 used for magnitude

d20 is either a pass or fail depending on if the result is less than a threshold or not
checks are contested when possible, and are done out in the open
if a contested check doesn't make sense, a set difficulty can take place of the opposing check

d12 shows how impactful that success or failure is (a 1 means success/failure, but only barely, while a 12 means critical success or failure)

natural 1 or 20 on the d20 is used by weapons for critical hit/miss effects

# Abilities
:::caution rough idea
stamina points

can be used to power spells or powerful fighting moves

limited amount that recharges after a full night's rest

can take damage to any health category in lieu of using stamina, if stamina is already expended
:::

# Luck Points
:::caution rough idea
pool of points, 2 for each player, including game master

are either "lucky" or "unlucky"

a player can use a lucky point to reroll any failed roll, after which it becomes unlucky

a player can also use an unlucky point to reroll a successful one, after which it becomes lucky again

in addition, the game master can use an unlucky point to force a reroll on anything, good or bad, after which it becomes lucky again

idea is to give the players more authority in narrative freedom, but only when it really counts, and at a price

also gives game masters a chance to be more transparent when it comes to fudging rolls, as it can be done out in the open by using luck points
