## Introduction
what's an rpg lol

## It's All About Fun!
don't compromise on fun for any reason. make sure you are always communicating with each other so everybody can have fun and nobody feels left out. immersion is cool and is a goal, but it's never worth compromising on communication. (figure out how to say this thing better)

## Setting Expectations & Boundaries
consent regarding roleplay topics and player agency is super important. it's better to establish these things before the game begins than to have frustration that can interrupt or ruin a game later down the line

## Ways to Play
different rpg archetypes

## "Session Zero"
