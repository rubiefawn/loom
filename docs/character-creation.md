## Ability Scores
Ability scores are values that represent the inborn ability and potential of a character or creature. Ability scores can either be weak, average, or strong. Ability scores are used during checks and determine what dice are rolled and how. There are six ability scores:

- **Brawn**, which represents physical strength and constitution.
- **Dexterity**, which represents physical finesse.
- **Intuition**, which represents gut sense.
- **Acumen**, which represents intelligence and brainpower.
- **Resolve**, which represents identity and determination.
- **Charisma**, which represents social finesse.

## Skills
skills are +1 to +5, learned

### Breakthroughs
improving a skill requires you to both pass and fail a number of checks equal to twice its rating. only the first pass and first failure between long rests may be counted towards this (a +3 would require six successes, each which must be separated by a long rest, as well as six failures also each separated by a long rest.)
